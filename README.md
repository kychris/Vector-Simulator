# Vector-Simulator

A simple first-person vector simulator that can draw vector lines and calculate dot and cross product.

The player can utilize a simple to use first person control to fly around the lines drawn in the virtual world. 

However, the sad thing is that I started using github too late, only an initial version that has the vector drawing functionality is saved.
